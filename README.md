# World Flag Classifier
### Project Description
This goal of this project was to learn about comparing Images in python by analyzing the flags of all 195 countries. All of the information about the flags was scraped from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallery_of_sovereign_state_flags). The provided GUI allows the user to analyze the similarity between different flags and also find which countries have the most similar flags (ex. Chad and Romania).
### Flagpy
In order to complete this project, I created a python library called Flagpy, which can be found [here](https://pypi.org/project/flagpy/). This library has lots of functions which allow the user to analyze different world flags and also identify flags from images.
